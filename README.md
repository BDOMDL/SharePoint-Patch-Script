# SharePoint Patch Script
An updated version of Russ Maxwell's "5 hour" SharePoint Patch Script supporting SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. Original created for SharePoint 2013 by Russ Maxwell, this script has been updated with a few new features:

* Support for sharePoint 2016 and SharePoint 2013 in the same script
* Support for multiple patch files for both platforms
* Support for pausing/stopping multiple SharePoint Search Service Applications

Upcoming features include:

* Conversion to a PowerShell Module
* Disable resuming of Search (this would be useful in patching multiple SharePoint servers)
* Better information on what the script is doing
* Cleanup!
